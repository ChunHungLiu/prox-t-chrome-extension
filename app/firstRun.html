    <h3><a id="user-content-what-is-prox-t" class="anchor" href="#what-is-prox-t" aria-hidden="true"></a>What is prox-t?</h3>

<p>A simple chrome extension that allows users to watch twitch streams via a different regional twitch datacenter instead of the default one that twitch usually assigns them.</p>

<h3><a id="user-content-why-would-anybody-want-to-do-that" class="anchor" href="#why-would-anybody-want-to-do-that" aria-hidden="true"></a>Why would anybody want to do that?</h3>

<p>Many people have problems maintaining a quick constant connection to their closest twitch data center due to their ISPs bad routing or throttling twitch traffic.</p>

<h3><a id="user-content-how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"></a>How it works?</h3>

<p>When a stream first starts a request is made to a central twitch server (usher) this server assigns the user a server in a data center close to the users geographical location.  This application works by proxying this single request though a server in a different location to the user. This means that twitch assigns the user a slot in a different data center. Generally the users ISP hasn't throttled traffic to this server.</p>

<h3><a id="user-content-what-location-should-i-choose" class="anchor" href="#what-location-should-i-choose" aria-hidden="true"></a>What location should I choose?</h3>

<p>For the best results I recommend selecting a server close to you and move further away until it works.</p>

<h3><a id="user-content-will-it-work-for-me" class="anchor" href="#will-it-work-for-me" aria-hidden="true"></a>Will it work for me?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately this is hard question to answer. Also the extension currently only solves a couple of very specific problems. If you only experience lag occasionally then it probably wont help you yet.</p>

<p>The quickest and most reliable way to tell if it helps is to give it a go.</p>

<p>If you want to get an idea of what quality you should be able to watch head over to <a href="http://speedtest.net">speedtest.net</a> run do a speed test and match your speed against the table below.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Speed</th>
<th>Quality</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>3.5Mb+</td>
<td>Source*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.5Mb</td>
<td>High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>750Kb</td>
<td>Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>550Kb</td>
<td>Low</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>250Kb</td>
<td>Mobile</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The above limits are theoretical you will need to have a connection slightly quicker because connections are generally unstable. Also if you are doing anything else on the internet then you will require a higher speed. </p>

<p>*The speed required for Source varies on the bitrate that the broadcaster is streaming at, most popular broadcasters use 3500Kb/s.</p>

<h3><a id="user-content-i-have-the-extension-install-and-enabled-but-it-still-doesnt-do-anything" class="anchor" href="#i-have-the-extension-install-and-enabled-but-it-still-doesnt-do-anything" aria-hidden="true"></a>I have the extension install and enabled but it still doesn't do anything</h3>

<p>Try multiple streams, if that doesn't help the unfortunately the extension in it's current state probably can't help you.</p>

<p>There is lots of help out there for people who experience lag. You can try contacting twitch by filling out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Y9ATuT6eCafDWPz5PtJkIImv1TE9q4l6oz-DzRBFQSA/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">this form</a> sometimes they can spot issues and put pressure on ISPs to sort them.</p>

<p>Sometimes the problem is a mixture of an unstable connection and the flash player that twitch use. A solution for this is to use <a href="http://docs.livestreamer.io/#">livestreamer</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="user-content-what-more-is-to-come" class="anchor" href="#what-more-is-to-come" aria-hidden="true"></a>What more is to come?</h3>

<p>First I hope to polish off the current functionality, make it easier to use and add some more backend servers to allow users to connect to a wider range of twitch servers.</p>

<p>Next I want to add the ability for users to proxy the entire stream through a server not just the first request. This will probably turn out to be quite expensive as it will require me to proxy a lot of traffic.</p>

<p>I also want to add the ability to manually set the size of the buffer that twitch uses. I have an idea of how this will work but I need to try it out and see if it's technically possible. If it does it should help people who have unstable but quick connections.</p>
